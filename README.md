# Python-Projects

Just a collection of simple projects that have helped me learned Python programming.

* **Bulk File Renamer**: Allows the user to select a folder of files to be renamed, indicate the file type, and specify the desired prefix for the new names. *Note: Currently working on incorporating advanced functionality for assigning names based on file content*
* **Password Generator**: Allows the user to either generate a random password (between 8 and 20 characters long) and copy it to the clipboard (and optionally save it) or enter their own password and save it to a text document for safekeeping.
* **mapIt**: Opens Google Maps to the location specified by the user.


## To-Do
* For password generator:
	+ Encryption
* For bulk file renamer:
	+ Add functionality for different file types
	+ Add more file-naming options
